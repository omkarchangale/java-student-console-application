Student Information System
Java Console Application
Project Summary :
The Student Information System is a Java-based console application developed to manage student records efficiently using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
The system supports full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and demonstrates practical usage of Java collections, encapsulation, and user input handling.
This project was developed as part of academic and internship preparation to showcase clean coding practices and logical problem-solving skills in Java.

Project Objectives :
Implement real-world CRUD functionality using Java
Apply Object-Oriented Programming concepts effectively
Handle dynamic data using Java Collections
Build a menu-driven, user-friendly console application
Gain hands-on experience with structured program design

Concepts Demonstrated :
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Classes & Objects
Encapsulation
Constructors
Java Collections (ArrayList)
Scanner class for input handling
Conditional logic & loops
Modular programming approach

Technology Stack :
Language	Java
JDK	Java 8+
Interface	Console
IDE	VS Code
Data Storage	In-memory (ArrayList)

Installation & Execution Prerequisites :
Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or above)
Java-compatible IDE or Terminal

Run via IDE :
1. Open IDE
2. Import/Open StudentInformationSystem.java
3. Run the main class
4. Follow the on-screen menu

Application Workflow :
1. Add Student
2. View All Students
3. Search Student
4. Update Student
5. Delete Student
6. Exit
Each operation is performed based on Student ID, ensuring unique record identification.

Known Limitations :
No persistent storage (data resets on exit)
Console-based interface only
Limited input validation
Single-user environment
